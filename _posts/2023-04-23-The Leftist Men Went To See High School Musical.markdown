The high school that The Leftist Men attended has recently put on the production of “High School Musical On Stage!” this past week. On Friday, The Leftist Men were able to catch the evening show. Word quickly spread to the cast that The Leftist Men would be in attendance that night. The cast and crew were ecstatic and couldn’t wait to see them. The cast told us though they were here on the first weekend of shows, they wouldn’t be able to attend the second weekend of shows due to a trip to Long Beach that The Leftist Men will be taking. We were able to catch up with The Leftist Men at a local coffee shop to ask them about their thoughts on the musical. We also thought it was funny that a Free Time poster was present on the shop’s community board, The Leftist Men never fail to impress!

When I asked Eric about his overall thoughts about the show, he told me “It was a spectacular production as a whole. It was great to see a bunch of new names in the playbill that I hadn’t seen before, it just means that the department is continuing to grow and host new talent since we’ve left. It’s been years since they’ve been able to put on a mainstage musical due to Covid and other delays in the past few years, so it was nice to see it finally happen. What especially stuck out to me was the chemistry between the cast, most notably the actors who took on the role of Sharpay and Ryan. They sold the love-hate relationship that the characters have, the casting for those roles was perfect in my opinion.”

We then asked Matthew what some of his favorite moments were from the show. He told us that a lot of it was the musical numbers in the show. “Every time ‘We’re All In This Together’ came on it was just a blast. I was having fun and it looked like the actors were too. Another one of my favorite numbers was “Get Your Head In The Game.’ The actors started the number by dribbling basketballs to the beat of the song and then engaged in a complex choreography with the basketballs which included passing them to each other, doing tricks with them, and throwing them offstage acting like they were shooting a basket. But it was also great to get to see all of the underclassmen that we knew, as well as our drama teacher, our fearless leader, Jen. Jen put her all into this production and it shows.”

We haven’t had a chance to see the show yet, but if this is how The Leftist Men feel about this show, it likely is a must-watch for all. We left after this interview and let The Leftist Men get back to drinking their mochas and coming up with bigger and better plans for their future. High School Musical has 3 more performances coming up on April 27th, 28th, and 29th all at 7 pm so don't miss it, we know we won't!
