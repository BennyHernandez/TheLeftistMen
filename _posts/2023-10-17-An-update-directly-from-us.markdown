Firstly we’d like to apologize to our incredible and loyal fans for not keeping everyone up to date with everything going on. David’s been pretty busy since his Free TIme review and we’ve been hard at work in college, so we haven’t been able to get any content out and for that, we apologize. We appreciate your unbroken support, especially in a time like this. We have a lot of great ideas and projects in the works right now and we have no plans of slowing down, they’ll just need some more time before they’re ready. Since David’s last article that he released, we’ve set up a mailing list, so each of these articles are going to go directly to you, as well as the newsletters once we get those up and running. We know that a lot of you have already signed up for the mailing list and it’s regrettable that we haven’t been able to use it yet, but that is of our own doing.

But we also wanted to clear something else up with everyone. The Leftist Men as we know, it and as many of you know it, began somewhere around November 2021. The exact date is a little fuzzy, but we believe it is somewhere around November 19th of that year. This is what we believed and have believed for quite some time. The first recorded evidence of us needing to refer to ourselves as The Leftist Men occurred on December 4th, where a meeting took place outside Evan’s house. And that’s kind of how it’s been since. 

Some other notable dates:

But we haven’t been totally honest with everyone. Going back late 2021, when The Leftist Men first started, it seems that we forgot something. A mention of The Leftist Men going as far back as September 18th, 2021. Exciting stuff right? But there’s a twist. It wasn’t us that referred to ourselves as The Leftist Men, it was Lea.

This picture was sent in to us by Emma, where Lea refers to Eric as a Leftist Man. This is likely where we got the name The Leftist Men from. Again our memory is a bit fuzzy, but it was likely the case that Eric liked the title “Leftist Man”, told Evan, Matthew, and Ben about it and they all agreed with the namesake and took it on as their own. We took this phrase with a seemingly negative connotation and made it into something new, something that we felt better represented ourselves, and it’s been that way since. But we wanted to give Lea the credit she deserves in her role of creating The Leftist Men because without her calling Eric a Leftist Man, who knows where we’d be today and what the four of us would look like. 

Lea is currently in her 2nd year at UCLA majoring in PoliSci. If you want to support Lea and her sisters, you can check out the youtube channel Lea and Sophia for daily content from Lea and her sister, Sophia.

We hope you all enjoyed this update, directly from us. We’re sorry we’ve been so quiet these past few months, we’ve all had a lot to do recently. Three of us are involved in a production of Lend Me A Tenor at our college and so it’s taking up a lot of our Free Time. But once it’s done, we’ll have a lot more time to focus on The Leftist Men as a whole. We even have some of the cast of Lend Me A Tenor helping us out and giving us ideas for The Leftist Men, so we have exciting things coming up. Also, there may or may not be a new play being written by The Leftist Men pretty soon after Lend Me A Tenor finishes, so be on the lookout.

As always,

Lefolg!
