This past Saturday, RTAA hosted its 3rd annual Champagne Gala. The event, originally meant to raise funds for theatre during the pandemic, is a yearly event to raise money for the theater and offer a night of luxury theatre. Dressing up was very highly encouraged, so of course The Leftist Men had to take up the opportunity to dress up and support their local theater, as well as a few people they knew in the cast. Joining The Leftist Men at the gala on Saturday were Gianna and Kyra, friends of The Leftist Men as well as cast members of LMAT who played The Bellhop and Maggie, respectively.

Coming directly off the heels of Lend Me A Tenor, Analyse and Maddy, who played Diana and Maggie respectively, went into rehearsing for the Champagne Gala as soon as LMAT closed. Analyse and Maddy were joined by a stunning and dazzling cast full of actors both young and old, even some from the drama program that The Leftist Men were a part of in high school. I arrived at the gala a little early, but some of the actors were already out greeting guests as they came in. Analyse spotted me in the crowd and began to talk with me. When I asked about her reaction to finding out The Leftist Men were coming tonight, she told me, “I was stunned, I thought it was a joke at first. I nearly dropped my glass of champagne when I found out it wasn’t.” she said. “I’m obviously excited, but a little nervous as well. I’ve never even seen all four Leftist Men together at once, let alone perform in front of them.” Analyse chose to sing “There Are Worse Things I Could Do” from Grease. She instantly threw the crowd for a curveball by entering through the aisles of the audience and used the space just below the stage for a good portion of the piece. She continued through the piece with her electrifying vocals and belts. I and the rest of the crowd went wild after her fantastic performance. Maddy followed up directly after Analyse and sang “My New Philosophy” from You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown. Maddy’s performance was just as captivating as the last. All of her movements on the stage looked very well thought out and had meaning to it. The character she is portraying in this piece is Sally, and she really did a great job with the characterization of her, and with outstanding vocals on top of that, another fantastic performance. 

Further into the night, Maddy and Analyse paired up to sing a duet from Wicked, “What Is This Feeling”. I was not familiar with this song at first, but soon after learned more about it. Yet again, these two took their characters and ran with them and you could really tell they were having fun with what they were doing. The fact that they were roommates, at least at this point in the show, came off very clearly. Alongside them, they had a backing ensemble singing along with them and about them. Throughout Maddy and Analyse’s beautiful harmonies, the vocals of the ensemble cast with them, and the choreography, it led to a number I’m sure to never forget. Every performance was also accompanied by other cast members in character sitting at dimly lit tables, watching and cheering on the actors that were currently performing. A moment in the show that stood out to me was when one of the older men of the cast did a flip over a pole as well as a cartwheel across the stage. The actor looked to be in his 50s or 60s, so it was impressive seeing these stunts done by someone his age; I know I definitely couldn’t pull those things off if I tried.

Overall, the gala had a massive turnout, and was a huge success, both financially and socially. It was a beautiful experience from beginning to end and I really enjoyed all the performances from every single one of the talented individuals onstage. I also heard all throughout the night, fantastic riffs from The Leftist Men, it had me crying from laughter. The gala was a wonderful night at the theater full of drinks, desserts, and friends. I know I’m looking forward to next year’s gala and I’m sure everyone else is. I’m even already planning out my outfit.
