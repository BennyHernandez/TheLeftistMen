  <h1 class="text-header">Introducing: <i>Free Time</i></h1>
  <p class="text-description">
    <i>Free Time</i> is a musical created by LEFOLG that tells the story of four
    high school boys struggling to find a balance between their academic
    responsibilities and their desire for leisure time. The show features catchy
    tunes, powerful lyrics, and a thought-provoking message that resonates with
    audiences of all ages.<br />
    The plot follows the boys as they navigate the challenges of high school
    life, encountering various characters along the way, including a strict
    drama teacher who pushes them to their limits, a rebellious classmate who
    encourages them to let loose, and a wise janitor who teaches them the value
    of hard work and perseverance. Through a series of heartfelt solos and
    musical numbers, the boys express their frustrations, dreams, and hopes for
    the future, ultimately learning that itâ€™s essential to make time for the
    things that matter most.<br />
    LEFOLG recently announced the addition of a new cast member, Emma, who will
    be taking on the role of the drama teacher. Emma has a long history with
    LEFOLG over the years. Her casting was an easy decision for the team as they
    were seeking someone who embodied the spirit of <i>Free Time</i> as much as
    they did.<br />
    LEFOLG, along with Ike and Emma and are eager to present it to the world.
    They are eagerly anticipating the world premiere on May 31st, and audiences
    can expect a moving and inspiring production that speaks to the universal
    struggles of adolescence and the importance of balancing hard work with
    leisure time.
