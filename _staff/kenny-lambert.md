Kenny was hired as the LEFOLG stuntman very recently, but has fit right into our team. Being a stuntman is one of the most dangerous jobs we do here at LEFOLG, but it is very necessary. When writing Free Time, The Men of LEFOLG knew that a stuntman would be necessary to accurately represent Eric's artistic vision. They contacted the Stuntmen's Association of Motion Pictures, and found Kenny. As it turns out, he had already heard about the work that LEFOLG was doing and was given a full time position. Kenny has just recently moved to the area, but it already feels like home thanks to LEFOLG. Besides work, he loves cooking and baking, and often brings in treats for the other staff in the office.
