David graduated class of 2018 from Sac State with a bachelor's degree in journalism. He is a full time writer, making almost all of the articles for the LEFOLG website. His favorite articles to write are play and musical reviews, sharing the opinions of The Men of LEFOLG as well as his own. David Taylor has always loved theatre, so working for LEFOLG was right up his alley. Before becoming a writer for LEFOLG, he worked at the Sacramento Business Journal, but was unhappy with his lack of free time. Having always been a fan, he saw a writing position had opened up here, and eventually became an official LEFOLG scholar. David loves attending local theatre and exploring local hiking trails in the Sacramento area with his wife.
