Being the receptionist for LEFOLG is a very busy job. Liberty has to answer calls, make appointments, as well as directing anybody who visits the LEFOLG headquarters. Before being hired, they didn't know a lot about LEFOLG, but after learning the important change that we create, they were ecstatic to be working for such a great organization. Liberty graduated from high school in Lincoln in 2020, and worked at Starbucks with Free Time actor Emma. Emma told Liberty that we were looking for a full time receptionist, and after hearing about the benefits they were convinced. Liberty loves the freedom and wealth that LEFOLG brings its employees. Liberty is currently working on coding and designing their own video game, with a generous grant from the LEFOLG Arts Foundation.
